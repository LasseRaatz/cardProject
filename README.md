# Welcome to PLACEHOLDER NAME FOR CARD PROJECT

This is a proof of concept for a game idea I have

It is by no means finished and the current build is only single player

I plan to expand the game to be a two player experience

## How to play
The game consist of two parts: A draft and a subsequent duel.

The draft is the only part of the game that requires any decision making from the player.

### The draft
The players gets the option to pick between three randomly selected cards.

The chosen card is added to the player's deck and the process is repeated untill the player has 20 cards in their deck.

### The duel
I will write an explaination here some day maybe
